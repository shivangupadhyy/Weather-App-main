# ☀️ Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App** repository! This project showcases a responsive weather application built with **JavaScript** and **ReactJS**, providing real-time weather updates and forecasts. 🌦️

## 🌍 Overview

The Weather App allows users to search for cities around the globe and retrieve weather details such as:
- **Current Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Wind Speed**
- **5-Day Forecast**

All this data is pulled in real-time using the **OpenWeatherMap API** for accurate weather information.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time weather updates**: Get instant weather details for any city in the world.
- **5-day forecast**: A quick glance at what the next five days hold.
- **Search functionality**: Simply type in a city name, and voilà! Instant results.
- **Responsive design**: Smooth experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **ReactJS state management**: Efficient handling of data with React's state and hooks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Front-end framework for building the UI.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic and API requests.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Real-time weather data source.
- **CSS3**: To style the application.
- **Axios**: For API calls.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Get your free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and add it to `.env` file:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🤖 How It Works

The Weather App uses **ReactJS** to dynamically render weather data fetched from the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The user inputs a city, and the app makes an API call to retrieve weather details for that location. React state management ensures efficient updates, and Axios handles the API requests seamlessly.
